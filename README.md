# Registration-Form
This is the user Registration Form that I built while Learning Angular.
This was a Part of my Assignment during my Internship.

In this Form I have used Reactive Forms, FormGroup, FormControls, Validators, Custom Pipes for User Name, Custom Pipes for Different Date Format as per the selected Country, Different Mobile Number as per the selected Country, use of Parent and child component where form passed from parent component is taken as input and displayed in child component and also made Use of Element Reference.

I Will update this repo as I learn new concepts in Angular.
